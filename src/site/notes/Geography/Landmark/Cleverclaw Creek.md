#### Summary
> Flowing from the Weeping Jester Falls south-west before joining with the Abhainn Nathair, this creek serves as a vital trade route to the Kobold city of [[Geography/City/Cri Chnuas\|Cri Chnuas]]. Run-off from various alchemical operations have recently began to foul the water of this thorough-fare.
