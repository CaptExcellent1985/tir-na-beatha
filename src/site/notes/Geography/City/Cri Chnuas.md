#### Summary
> Within the [[Geography/Region/Wellandrym Vale\|Wellandrym Vale]], the city of Cri Chnuas is a marvel of [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobold]] ingenuity. A sprawling cavern complex of multiple levels, only the upper-most one is open to other Tuatha. Entrance to the city is through [[Geography/Landmark/Cleverclaw Creek\|Cleverclaw Creek]], and requires a hefty toll to the [[The Tribes/Tritons\|Triton]] ferrymen that run the rivers. Landing at [[Geography/Locale/Matriarch's Rest\|Matriarch's Rest]], most travellers will immediately head to either the [[Geography/Locale/Scaled Market\|Scaled Market]] or the [[Geography/Locale/Ember-Belly Inn\|Ember-Belly Inn]]. The infamous Cinder-Cask Ale is brewed here in the city, with a brewery open to the public for tasting and direct sales. A shrine devoted to [[Religion/Pantheon/Cernunnos\|Cernunnos]] is also located on the primary level. 
> Access to the lower levels is strictly prohibited. Non-[[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobolds]] who wish to gain access must prove themselves to be trustworthy to the tribe, or prove they have the favour of [[Religion/Pantheon/Cernunnos\|Cernunnos]] himself. Natives of the City are aware of many secret tunnels that lead to and from it, and hold this knowledge tightly. Even if non-[[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobolds]] were to learn of them, they are constructed to be so tiny and so full of traps that only a [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobold]] could navigate them. 


#### Politics
###### Devoted Hivemind
> Where other [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobold]] colonies typically  have one or two central leaders that direct the [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobold]] hivemind for that colony, Cri Chnuas differs in this respect. With no identified figure, many [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobolds]] native to the city simply adopt their given role without any question or thought to who may hold power over them. Given the secretive nature of the [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobolds]], it is possible that this leadership is housed in the lower city, but to date no information of who this may be has surfaced.
