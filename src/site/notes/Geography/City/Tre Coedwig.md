#### Summary
> Located close to where the [[Geography/Region/Ceardlachd Forest\|Ceardlachd Forest]] becomes the [[Geography/Region/Fossmore Forest\|Fossmore Forest]], and only a few days journey from [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]], Tre Coedwig is a center for the lumber trade. It is often the first stop for trading caravans headed to the Dwarven capital at [[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]], or south to the Gnomish cities of [[Geography/City/Cogswyr\|Cogswyr]] and [[Geography/City/Eolas\|Eolas]]. Timber felled and processed here ends up in buildings as far flung as the [[Geography/Region/Whisperwood\|Whisperwood]], and Dwarven furniture and instruments carved from it are highly sought by all [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]]. 
> 
> Most visitors to the town are invited to set up camp outside of the protective walls of the Palisade, and the road leading in is often-lined with traders hawking their wares to passer-by. The main road leads past houses showcasing Dwarven carpentry techniques; multi-story marvels of joinery, built without a single nail.  In the center square,  [[Geography/Locale/The Oak and Acorn\|The Oak and Acorn]] Tavern provides accommodations and food more palatable to non-Dwarves, and some of the more prominent woodworkers have set up shop here. [[Geography/Locale/Knot Your Average Magic Shop\|Knot Your Average Magic Shop]] provides a variety of items designed by the towns only Gnomish resident to aid in the lumber industry. 
> 
> Tre Coedwig is also home to a [[The Tribes/Twilight Elves\|Twilight Elf]] Diaspora, which sees to the medical needs of the community through the work of the [[Factions/Order of the White Tower\|Order of the White Tower]] chapterhouse located in the town, led by the Dwarven Priestess, [[NPCs/Contemporary/Allani Xilltres\|Allani Xilltres]].  A druidic circle is also rumored to be present in the town, but in recent years the names of any members have been conveniently forgotten. 

#### Politics
###### High-Reeve and the Clans
> Tre Coedwig was the traditional family home of the Coedwig clan. The leader of the Clan would typically have overseen the governance of the town and provided the Faoi clans with the tools to serve as either lumberjacks or carpenters. However, in the wake of the [[History/Night of Shattered Shields\|Night of Shattered Shields]], the newly elected Lorcan turned his attention to a mining settlement in the [[Geography/Region/Cnoic Aran Mountains\|Cnoic Aran Mountains]] and appointed [[NPCs/Contemporary/Maircus Dealrach-faoi-Coedwig\|Maircus Dealrach-faoi-Coedwig]] as the leader of the town guard and the High-Reeve of Tre Coedwig to govern in his stead. 
> 
> [[NPCs/Contemporary/Maircus Dealrach-faoi-Coedwig\|Maircus]], in accordance with the decrees of the [[Factions/Ord Directorate\|Ord Directorate]], has direct authority over all that happens within the town. He wields this power carefully though, preferring to rule through consensus building with the locals. He honours the old ways, while ensuring that the tightening fist of the Ord-Ri does not crush Tre Coedwig. He works closely with the Faoi clans to meet production quotas, and to keep appearances of normalcy so as to not scare off outside traders.
