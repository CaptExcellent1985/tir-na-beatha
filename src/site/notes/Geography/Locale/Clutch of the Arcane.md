#### Summary
> Comprising several caverns in the upper level of [[Geography/City/Cri Chnuas\|Cri Chnuas]], the Clutch of the Arcane is home to the famed academy of [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobold]] Sorcerer's. It can be accessed by heading North from the [[Geography/Locale/Scaled Market\|Scaled Market]] and is in close proximity to the [[Geography/Locale/Ember-Belly Inn\|Ember-Belly Inn]], Cinder-cask Brewing, and [[Geography/Locale/The Cracked Shell\|The Cracked Shell]]. It's library, though not as large or diverse as the one found in [[Geography/City/Eolas\|Eolas]], serves [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobold]]-kind well. 

#### Notable Features

######  Hall of the Commons
> The almost-imperceptible buzzing of magic and [[The Tribes/Feyfolk\|fey]]-energy crackles so strongly in this cavern that even those not sensitive to it can feel its presence. Bluetile stone glimmers beneath levitating motes of wizard-light and the cavern is warmed by a constantly burning magical fire tended to by arcane neophytes. Stone benches line the walls where those seeking the counsel of Clutch magicians or to gain admittance to study here wait patiently to be heard. A crooked and wizened [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobold]] by the name of [[NPCs/Contemporary/Firebomb\|Firebomb]] manages the front-desk, typically thumbing absent-mindedly through a weathered book.

###### The Acolytes Kiln
> Fine [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] crafted wooden desks face a single lectern at the rear of this cavern that serves as the primary lecture hall for the [[Geography/Locale/Clutch of the Arcane\|Clutch of the Arcane]]. Students attend classes and guest lectures here, and there is ample room to the rear and sides of the cavern for them to practice their casting, enchanting, and alchemy.
