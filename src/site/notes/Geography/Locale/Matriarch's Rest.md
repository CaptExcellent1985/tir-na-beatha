#### Summary
> Jutting out into the current of the [[Geography/Landmark/Cleverclaw Creek\|Cleverclaw Creek]], Matriarch's Rest is the mooring point used by the [[The Tribes/Tritons\|Triton]] ferrymen and the primary disembarking point for visitors to [[Geography/City/Cri Chnuas\|Cri Chnuas]]. A ramp dug out of the cavern floor leads up to a landing where merchants can store their goods while they wait to settle-up at the [[The Tribes/Tritons\|Triton]]'s Toll-Office, and provides direct access to the [[Geography/Locale/Scaled Market\|Scaled Market]]. 

#### Notable Features
###### [[The Tribes/Tritons\|Triton]]'s Toll Office
> Crossing over a [[DM Screen/Tooltip Notes/Adv. Gear Notes/Rope\|rope]] bridge to the south leads to the [[The Tribes/Tritons\|Triton]] Toll Office. Here, a representative collects and processes tolls paid to the ferrymen and overseen by a [[Factions/Weave-mothers\|Silk-Matron]]. All toll's collected are then stored in a secure vault until they can be safely transported to the [[The Tribes/Tritons\|Triton]] capital of [[Geography/City/Fathom's Pride\|Fathom's Pride]].
