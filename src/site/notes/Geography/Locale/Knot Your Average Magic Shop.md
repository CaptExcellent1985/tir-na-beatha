#### Summary
> From the outside, this shop seems un-assuming, almost quaint. Located in the center square of [[Geography/City/Tre Coedwig\|Tre Coedwig]], it's single story is carved and planed of the finest of ironwood logged in the heart of the [[Geography/Region/Ceardlachd Forest\|Ceardlachd Forest]].

> Inside, however, patrons are greeted by the heavy scent of various chemical varnishes and polishes. The gnomish proprietor [[NPCs/Contemporary/Twig Tinkerer\|Twig Tinkerer]] is often hard at work at some new magical gadget, rarely taking notice of paying customers. An inventory of his wares reveals that all are meant to serve the local woodsmen and lumberjacks.
