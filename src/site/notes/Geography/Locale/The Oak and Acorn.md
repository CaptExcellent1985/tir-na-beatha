#### Summary
> Located just off the town square, The Oak and Acorn serves as an inn and tavern for non-Dwarves who come to stay in Tre Coedwig. It is two-stories and stocked with a variety of food and drinks fit for consumption by those lacking a Dwarven constitution. It is sometimes frequented by members of the town militia, and other Dwarves who do not wish to take their meals at their designated work camps.
