#### Quick Summary
> God of all the Wild Things, Cernunnos is sometimes worshipped by hunters and herders who seek to understand and tame the beasts of the land. He is also, however, the God of trickery, and delights in cleverness. Legends speak of his hand in the creation of the [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobolds]], [[The Tribes/Goblins\|Goblins]], and [[The Tribes/Tabaxi\|Tabaxi]]. 

#### Common Depictions
> Cernunnos has several depictions amongst the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]], reflecting their own relationship between themselves and his divine domains. The most popular one is that of the [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobolds]], where Cernunnos is shown to be a cloaked humanoid figure with the singular horn of a stag on the left side of his head and a tangle of briars and thorns where the second antler should be. Typically the cloak he wears is one of living moss and leaves. Nicknamed "The Briar-Horn" and "Lord of the Tangled Path", it is a reflection of Cernunnos love of the wild and clever and his pledge to protect them. 
> 
> Amongst the [[The Tribes/Goblins\|Goblins]] and some [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobolds]] he is depicted as "The Grinning Shadow", a huddled figure lacking a face, instead only possessing a wide and toothy grin. Often-times, he is shown holding a finger to his "lips" as if to shush the viewer. This speaks to the sometimes stealthy nature of Cernunnos and his followers. 
> 
> For the Tabaxi, Cernunnos is the Patron of the Hunt, a God who taught them the ways of stealth and of the perfect kill by becoming one with wilds around them and to a complete understanding of their quarry. As such, they avoid direct depictions of Cernunnos, creating images of dense clusters of trees and leaves in which the silhouette of a horned figure is formed by the empty space. 

#### Rituals and Religious Observances
###### Offerings & Boons
> It is believed that Cernunnos favours sweet treats, so shrines devoted to the Trickster god are usually littered with baked goods and other confections. However, these offerings must be stolen in order to be considered worthy; only that which was obtained through guile will gain his favour. He also favours the offering of most stolen objects, and in prayer, any tale of gaining the upper hand through trickery or deceit. Clever and dastardly traps of both the lethal and non-lethal variety are often also presented as offerings at a shrine to Cernunnos.
> 
> Cernunnos offers several gifts to those who please him. The gift of *The Green Road* is invaluable for the smaller-folk of the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]], where in a clear path to ones goal or escape danger presents itself through an otherwise deadly thicket. The Golden Tongue offers Cernunnos faithful the ability to sway others through speech, and the gift of the *Wild-Heart* is sought by many Tabaxi who wish for a complete understanding of their prey. 
> 

###### Taboo's
> Although Cernunnos is the Patron of the Hunt, he views imprisonment as a grave sin. [[The Tribes/Goblins\|Goblin]] and [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobold]] shepherds thus have a more symbiotic relationship with many of their herd animals, taking great care that all of their needs are met. [[The Tribes/Tabaxi\|Tabaxi]] hunters believe in the clean kill, one in which the suffering of the prey is minimized. 
> 
> Cernunnos also frowns upon walking "the straight line". As a God of trickery and cleverness, he views the straight line to be too predictable and easy for ones enemies to impede progress. A path that twists and winds its way is confusing and clear only to the one walking it, and is frequently the path of the clever. 

###### A Boring World will be an Ending One
> Kobolds believe that the world is the dream of a sleeping dragon, and that Cernunnos plays an important role in keeping the dragon asleep. They believe that by playing minor pranks or tricks, they keep the dream entertaining and in so doing, entice the dragon to keep the dream going.

#### Myths, Legends, and Folklore

###### Creation of the Kobolds
>*In the Age of Silence, the Great Shimmering Wyrm curled its tail around the void and fell into the Eternal Slumber, breathing out the world in a cloud of wild magic. The mountains were its heavy thoughts, and the rivers were its steady pulse. But the world became too quiet, too orderly, and too serious. The Wyrm began to stir, letting out a Great Yawn that shook the stars, threatening to wake up and blink the world out of existence from sheer boredom. Cernunnos, seeing that the dream was fading, crept up to the sleeping dragon’s snout. He plucked a loose, iridescent scale and whispered a chaotic riddle into the Wyrm’s ear.*
>
*The dragon chuckled in its sleep, and that breath of laughter shattered the scale into thousands of tiny, scurrying pieces—the first Kobolds. Cernunnos blessed them with the spirit of the prank and the quickness of the lie, giving them a sacred charge: "Make the dream fun, or the Dreamer wakes." To this day, the Kobolds believe they are the guardians of the Eternal Slumber, causing just enough trouble to keep the Great Wyrm entertained in its dreams, ensuring the world does not vanish into the waking void*

###### The Price of Thickets
> *In the dawn of the world, the First Forest was a place of tall, straight trees with no undergrowth, a realm of perfect Order where the weak had nowhere to hide from the gaze of the Golden Hawk, the hunter of the skies. Cernunnos saw his children—the runt-races of goblin and kobold—scurrying in terror, picked off one by one in the open glades. Realizing that a pristine world was a death sentence for the small, the God of Wild Things reached up and snapped off his right antler, the ivory cracking like thunder. He cast the broken bone into the soil, and where it struck, the first thickets of blackberry and briar exploded from the earth—snarled, chaotic, and sharp—offering a painful sanctuary that only the small and desperate could enter.*
> 
> *The Golden Hawk shrieked and turned away, unable to pierce the gloom of the brush, but Cernunnos was left wounded. Instead of healing into smooth bone, wild vines and blackthorns crept from his brow to stanch the bleeding, weaving themselves into a dark, twisted horn. He wears it still as the Lord of the Tangled Path—a reminder that survival is rarely pretty, and that safety always costs a little bit of blood.*

###### The Iron Cage
> *Govannon the Smith once boasted that he could build a cage that could hold anything. He forged a box of cold iron, inscribed with runes of absolute Order, and challenged Cernunnos to escape it.*
> 
> *Cernunnos laughed and stepped inside. Govannon locked the door and threw away the key, declaring victory. But Cernunnos did not pick the lock, nor did he bend the bars. He simply sat down and waited. Time passed. A single seed in Cernunnos’s pocket sprouted. A vine grew. It twisted around the iron bars, rusting them with its sap. Roots cracked the foundation. The iron grew brittle and flaked away into rust.*
> 
> *When the cage finally crumbled to dust, Cernunnos stood up, brushed the rust from his shoulder, and said, 'Iron endures for an age. The Wild endures forever.'"*
