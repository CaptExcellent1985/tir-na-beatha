#### Physical Appearance

> With furrowed brow and frown lines like scars, Maircus is a middle-aged Dwarf of ornery temperament. His grey-dusted red hair is shorter than typical Dwarf fashion, as is his double-braided beard. His armor, custom-made furs with wood panels woven into it, reminds him of the responsibility he carries towards his fellow clansmen. 

#### Personality

###### The Strains of Leadership
> Maircus has a desire to be seen as worthy of the role that has been thrust upon him. As a younger Dwarf, he was often seen laughing and singing along with a different group during every communal meal. Serving in the town militiar, he was skilled at settling disputes between clansmen without resorting to violence and with all parties walking away happy. After being appointed as High-Reeve and the Captain in charge of the militia, his demeanour began to change. In his attempts to keep the pressure off of the Faoi clans of Tre Coedwig, he has taken much of it on to himself, and this shows in his gruff attitude. Beneath it though, still beats the heart of a man who is trying to maintain a peaceful life for those under his protection. 


#### Biography 

> Maircus never wanted to be in his current position. A capable hunter and fighter, he joined the town militia and served the Coedwig family dutifully for many years. He was particularly adept at solving arguments and having both parties satisfied at the end of it. He served under [[NPCs/Contemporary/Torin Iron-Heart\|Torin Iron-Heart]] during the [[History/War of the Severed Root\|War of the Severed Root]], and was present when the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]] captured Tre Coedwig. Under [[NPCs/Contemporary/Torin Iron-Heart\|Torin]]'s command, he felt that the General's tactics were often too heavy-handed and was glad when the High Bench opted to sign the [[History/Treaty of Green Ash\|Treaty of Green Ash]]. He kept his opinions of this private, not even sharing them with his child-hood friend, Lorcan Ceardaigh. After the [[History/Night of Shattered Shields\|Night of Shattered Shields]], when Lorcan was elected as Clan leader, Maircus was shocked when he was appointed the High-Reeve of Tre Coedwig.
