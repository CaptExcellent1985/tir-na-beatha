#### Physical Appearance

> Barrel-chested and imposing, Torins age only adds to the strength and force of will he exudes. With silver hair and braided beard, he views the world with gleaming blue eyes that command the attention of those who stand in his presence. His suit of plate armor, forged from black iron and periodically venting steam, is as unyielding as Torin himself. 

#### Personality

###### The Hammer of [[Religion/Pantheon/Govannon\|Govannon]]
> Torin see's himself as the living embodiment of [[Religion/Pantheon/Govannon\|Govannon]]'s hammer, as the implement that the God uses to  forge and shape the world into order. His word is absolute, each sentence a command to be carried out with unflinching resolve. He asks no questions, relying on skilled interrogators to speak for him when the need arises. 

###### Iron Over Wood
> Torin views the [[History/Discovery of Iron\|discovery of iron]] as a gift to the [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] and as the fulfillment of a prophecy. He respects the old ways of the [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|Dwarves]], paying lip service to the hard-working carpenters and woodsmen of the Tribe, but he has become obsessed with Iron. To Torin, it is cold, rigid, and unyielding - qualities he wishes to instill in his people. 

#### Biography 

> Torin's long life has been spent in the pursuit of power. From a young age, he saw the [[History/Discovery of Iron\|discovery of iron]] as the fulfillment of a divine prophecy, that the [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] would come to lead the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] into mastery over the [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|Anord]] and the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]]. Becoming the leader of Clan [[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]] in his mid-20's, he was imprisoned in [[Geography/Landmark/Dún Réamheola\|Dún Réamheola]] for a short time after he attempted to force the clan's to abandon the knot currency in favor of his own - the Iron Scrip. Shortly after gaining his freedom, he began to consolidate his power and influence with the other clan's. He served as the Dwarven delegate on the [[Factions/Council of Aite-Briethe\|Council of Aite-Briethe]], where he argued for the dissolution of the Weave-mother's and for bringing the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] under the direct control of the Council. He returned to [[Geography/Region/Ceardlachd Forest\|Ceardlachd Forest]] when the [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] warred with the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]] and used the opportunity to declare himself as the Ord-Ri of the [[Factions/Ord Directorate\|Ord Directorate]], and gave himself the surname of Iron-Heart.
