#### Physical Appearance

> Of average height and medium build, Voshtai's physical appearance would be un-imposing if not for his strong character and storied history with the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]]. Possessed of green scales and a dappled yellow tail-fin that can sometimes give away the emotions he tries to hide. 

#### Personality

###### Sanctity of the Oath
> Above all else, Voshtai views his duty to the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] and to the [[The Tuatha\|Tuatha]] to be paramount. Honour means everything to Voshtai, as well as the keeping of one's word. The [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Verdant Oath\|Verdant Oath]] is more sacred to Voshtai than any decree of the God's. 

 
###### The Bones of His Mentors
> His strongest bond is to his deceased mentor, [[NPCs/Contemporary/Vethos\|Vethos]]. His spear, fashioned from [[NPCs/Contemporary/Vethos\|Vethos]]'s own bones, is a physical tether to the man who saw potential in a "runt." He is also inextricably bound to [[NPCs/Contemporary/Elara of the Whispering Moss\|Elara]] (his only remaining anchor to his youth) and the memory of Saoirse, whose literal body now serves as the shield he is sworn to protect.

###### Burden of the Bridge
>Voshtai suffers from survivor’s guilt transformed into hyper-rigid perfectionism. He blames the "lack of discipline" for [[NPCs/Contemporary/Cormac McCarthy\|Cormac]]’s death rather than the chaos of wild magic. This makes him a demanding, sometimes suffocating leader who struggles to trust "luck" or "abandon," fearing that any moment of joy or recklessness will lead to another [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Fomorian Breach]].

###### Redemption through Instruction
>It is through his careful instruction and demonstration that Voshtai believes he can make up for his failing's during the [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Fomorian Breach]] and the [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Rogue Scholar's Crisis]].  By guiding new [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Foghlaimi]] and instilling in them the importance of precision and planning, then no other [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Laochra]] will need to suffer the same fate of his. 

#### Biography 

> Serving as [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Saois]] to all new [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Foghlaimi]] who survive [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|The Proving]] and join the ranks of the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]], Voshtai is a stoic [[The Tribes/Lizard-folk\|Lizard-folk]] warrior whose precision in battle has served him well. 

###### Early Life
> Born to a Peat-Iron prospector, Voshtai was one of a clutch of 7 in [[Geography/City/Bone Cairn\|Bone Cairn]]. He was the runt of the litter, and constantly bullied by his larger brothers and sisters. An elderly [[The Tribes/Lizard-folk\|Lizard-folk]] by the name of [[NPCs/Contemporary/Vethos\|Vethos]] took pity on this runt and began to teach him principles of defence. [[NPCs/Contemporary/Vethos\|Vethos]] also instilled in Voshtai the virtues of honour and of defending the weak. 
> 
> At the age of 11, [[NPCs/Contemporary/Vethos\|Vethos]] was invited to participate in [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|The Proving]] after he foiled an attempt by [[Kozok the Broken Gaze\|Kozok the Broken Gaze]] to escape her imprisonment through the use of boggles. It is here when Voshtai learned of the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]], of the [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Verdant Oath\|Verdant Oath]], and he swore that he would follow in his mentor's footsteps.
> 
> When Voshtai turned 15, he began to accompany his father on expeditions into the swamps of the [[Geography/Region/Draigsreach Peninsula\|Draigsreach Peninsula]]. His first weapon was a spear he crafted himself from shards of obsidian and pieces of driftwood. It has broken many times in his early adventures, and he dutifully repaired it each time. It now rests in his quarters at [[Geography/Locale/Siorlann\|Siorlann]], a reminder of his beginnings.

###### Initiation into the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]]
> When Voshtai was 17, he uncovered a Tiefling smuggling operation that used Bucca (small Fey spirits with obsidian skin and wings) to locate iron shipments. He devised a plan to fool the Bucca's "locate object" magic, and single-handedly fought the Tiefling encampment. This earned him some renown amongst his fellow [[The Tribes/Lizard-folk\|Lizard-folk]], and it was not long before he received an invitation to participate in [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|The Proving]]. > 

###### 'The Sinking Stone'
> At [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|The Proving]], Voshtai was to meet the members of what would become his [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Laochra]]. Nicknamed 'The Sinking Stone', his [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Laochra]] had a reputation for surviving almost impossible odds. It was said that you could cast them into the deepest of waters and they would get to the bottom of it. 
> 
> 'The Sinking Stone' was made up of [[NPCs/Contemporary/Cormac McCarthy\|Cormac McCarthy]], [[NPCs/Contemporary/Elara of the Whispering Moss\|Elara of the Whispering Moss]], [[NPCs/Contemporary/Kaelen Quick-Step\|Kaelen Quick-Step]], and [[NPCs/Contemporary/Saiorse the Unblinking\|Saiorse the Unblinking]].  The [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] still tell legends of their many exploits, from the [[Hunting of Rot Tooth\|Hunting of Rot Tooth]], to the [[Siege of Trust Knot\|Siege of Trust Knot]], and the [[Grey-Rot Harvest\|Grey-Rot Harvest]].
