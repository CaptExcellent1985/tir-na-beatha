#### Physical Appearance

> Of average height and medium build, Voshtai's physical appearance would be un-imposing if not for his strong character and storied history with the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]]. Possessed of green scales and a dappled yellow tail-fin that can sometimes give away the emotions he tries to hide. 

#### Personality

###### Sanctity of the Oath
> Above all else, Voshtai views his duty to the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] and to the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] to be paramount. Honour means everything to Voshtai, as well as the keeping of one's word. The [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Verdant Oath\|Verdant Oath]] is more sacred to Voshtai than any decree of the God's. 

 
###### The Bones of His Mentors
> His strongest bond is to his deceased mentor, [[NPCs/Contemporary/Vethos\|Vethos]]. His spear, fashioned from [[NPCs/Contemporary/Vethos\|Vethos]]'s own bones, is a physical tether to the man who saw potential in a "runt." He is also inextricably bound to [[NPCs/Contemporary/Elara of the Whispering Moss\|Elara]] (his only remaining anchor to his youth) and the memory of Saoirse, whose literal body now serves as the shield he is sworn to protect.

###### Burden of the Bridge
>Voshtai suffers from survivor’s guilt transformed into hyper-rigid perfectionism. He blames the "lack of discipline" for [[NPCs/Contemporary/Cormac McCarthy\|Cormac]]’s death rather than the chaos of wild magic. This makes him a demanding, sometimes suffocating leader who struggles to trust "luck" or "abandon," fearing that any moment of joy or recklessness will lead to another [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Fomorian Breach]].

###### Redemption through Instruction
>It is through his careful instruction and demonstration that Voshtai believes he can make up for his failing's during the [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Fomorian Breach]] and the [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Rogue Scholar's Crisis]].  By guiding new [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Foghlaimi]] and instilling in them the importance of precision and planning, then no other [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Laochra]] will need to suffer the same fate of his. 

#### Biography 

> Serving as [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Saois]] to all new [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Foghlaimi]] who survive [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|The Proving]] and join the ranks of the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]], Voshtai is a stoic [[The Tribes/Lizard-folk\|Lizard-folk]] warrior whose precision in battle has served him well. 

###### Early Life
> Born to a Peat-Iron prospector, Voshtai was one of a clutch of 7 in [[Geography/City/Bone Cairn\|Bone Cairn]]. He was the runt of the litter, and constantly bullied by his larger brothers and sisters. An elderly [[The Tribes/Lizard-folk\|Lizard-folk]] by the name of [[NPCs/Contemporary/Vethos\|Vethos]] took pity on this runt and began to teach him principles of defence. [[NPCs/Contemporary/Vethos\|Vethos]] also instilled in Voshtai the virtues of honour and of defending the weak. 
> 
> At the age of 11, [[NPCs/Contemporary/Vethos\|Vethos]] was invited to participate in [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|The Proving]] after he foiled an attempt by [[Kozok the Broken Gaze\|Kozok the Broken Gaze]] to escape her imprisonment through the use of boggles. It is here when Voshtai learned of the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]], of the [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Verdant Oath\|Verdant Oath]], and he swore that he would follow in his mentor's footsteps.
> 
> When Voshtai turned 15, he began to accompany his father on expeditions into the swamps of the [[Geography/Region/Draigsreach Peninsula\|Draigsreach Peninsula]]. His first weapon was a spear he crafted himself from shards of obsidian and pieces of driftwood. It has broken many times in his early adventures, and he dutifully repaired it each time. It now rests in his quarters at [[Geography/Locale/Siorlann\|Siorlann]], a reminder of his beginnings.

###### Initiation into the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]]
> When Voshtai was 17, he uncovered a Tiefling smuggling operation that used Bucca (small Fey spirits with obsidian skin and wings) to locate iron shipments. He devised a plan to fool the Bucca's "locate object" magic, and single-handedly fought the Tiefling encampment. This earned him some renown amongst his fellow [[The Tribes/Lizard-folk\|Lizard-folk]], and it was not long before he received an invitation to participate in [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|The Proving]]. > 

###### 'The Sinking Stone'
> At [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|The Proving]], Voshtai was to meet the members of what would become his [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Laochra]]. Nicknamed 'The Sinking Stone', his [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Laochra]] had a reputation for surviving almost impossible odds. It was said that you could cast them into the deepest of waters and they would get to the bottom of it. 
> 
> 'The Sinking Stone' was made up of [[NPCs/Contemporary/Cormac McCarthy\|Cormac McCarthy]], [[NPCs/Contemporary/Elara of the Whispering Moss\|Elara of the Whispering Moss]], [[NPCs/Contemporary/Kaelen Quick-Step\|Kaelen Quick-Step]], and [[NPCs/Contemporary/Saiorse the Unblinking\|Saiorse the Unblinking]].  The [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] still tell legends of their many exploits, from the [[Hunting of Rot Tooth\|Hunting of Rot Tooth]], to the [[Siege of Trust Knot\|Siege of Trust Knot]], and the [[Grey-Rot Harvest\|Grey-Rot Harvest]].

#### DM Notes

- Add blurb about the [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Fomorian Breach]]
- Internal Logic: Although he may disagree with the PC’s choices, he believes strongly that Cailleotairi who survive the Proving have demonstrated a level of skill unsurpassed by normal Tuatha and gives even the greenest of Foghlaimi’s the freedom to deal with situations as they see fit. 
- The Hunting of Rot-Tooth: Age: 22: Hamlets in Dealt-Tradala were being terrorized by a Black Dragon Wyrmling that had grown large and cunning. Cailleotairi were charged with slaying the beast. Cormac wanted to charge the lair, but Voshtai recognized the sulfuric smell of mud nearby, and that the bog had become a flammable trap. Voshtai spent three days observing the dragons’ feeding patterns, noting it was blind in its left eye. His plan: Elara would use fog to obscure the terrain, Kaelen lured the beast into a narrow ravine, Voshtai waited submerged in the mud for hours breathing through a reed. When the beast passed over-head, Voshtai struck with his obsidian spear, and Cormac delivered the killing blow from above. 
- The Siege of Trust Knot: Age: 42: A particularly nasty Goblin Shaman led a warband of Trolls against the Tabaxi settlement of Trust Knot. The cities commander was poisoned by a Goblin assassin, leaving the defenders panicked and leaderless. The Laochra was in the area and held the line for re-inforcements to arrive. The siege lasted for three days, during which the Laochra did not rest. Cormac stood at the breached gate, piling bodies so high that they formed a barricade. Saoirse used her magic to light the bodies ablaze while Elara countered the shaman’s magical gloom. Voshtai realized the enemy was communicating by drum beat and together with Kaelen slipped out the back and eliminated the drummers while Voshtai did single combat with the Shaman, defeating him just as reinforcements arrived from Aite-Briethe. 
- The Grey-Rot Harvest: Age: 45: A plague known as “Scale-Rust” began infecting Lizard-folk. Kobold alchemists determined the only cure required was the pollen of the Grey-Rot Orchid, which only grew on the backs of Shambling Mounds and only in the most magic-saturated parts of the Tir. The Laochra located dormant Shambling Mounds in Doire Na Gealaich. Elara was tasked with singing a druidic lullaby to keep the Mounds asleep while Kaelen and Voshtai scaled the backs of the mounds. Reaching the top, Kaelen remarked that a single bloom could sell for a fortune in Cri Chnuas and was about to take more Orchid’s than needed. Voshtai caught his wrist, and just stared at Kaelen with his unblinking lizard eyes until the Tabaxi pulled his paw back. 
- The Fomorian Breach
Age: 47
In 1575 ATT, Chief Artificer Whirligig of the Cogswyr Syndicate unleashed the Anord in the area around Cogswyr. Surges of wild magic threatened outlying villages, trade caravans, and eventually the city itself. One such surge opened a rift to another plane of existence from which rotting and hulking giants emerged; Fomorians. Many Gnomes died before the Sinking Stone and other Cailleotairi forces were able to reach the city and offer aid. When they did, they found Whirligig hard at work, creating what she believed would be a stabilizing loci. It fell to the Sinking Stone to make sure that the loci was placed. They were joined by Voshtai’s mentor, Vethos. The plan was simple: Cormac and Vethos hold the line, while Saoirse weakened the magic of the Rift and Kaelen run the stabilizer into the center to seal it. Elara stayed behind to tend to the wounded.  
Chaos reigned over the battlefield that day. Gravity reversed randomly, fire turned to ice. As the Formorians charged, Cormac held the causeway. Kaelen held the stabilizer in his hand and as he sprinted towards the Rift, a Dimension Door opened. Within the Door was a shadowy figure. Voshtai shouted for Kaelen to turn back but watched instead as Kaelen handed the stabilizer to the figure which then proceeded to pull Kaelen through with him. 
Without the Stabilizer the Rift expanded. More Fomorians poured through. A surge of Wild Magic hit Cormac. His skin turned to iron, then to glass. A Fomorian Warlord shattered his shield-arm and Cormac looked to Voshtai, laughed and said to Voshtai “Hold the line, Needle” then tackled the Fomorian off the Causeway, falling to his death. 
Voshtai tried to reach Saiorse to protect her, but a Fomorian Champion swung a massive club towards him. Vethos pushed him out of the way, taking the full brunt of the blow to his chest. A surge of wild magic at that moment struck the Fomorian, turning him into a newt. Voshtai ran to Vethos' side and with his mentor's hand clutched in his, Vethos said his last words, “Do not die today. That is an order.”
Reaching Saoirse and out of options, she reached out to her Archfey Patron and offered a trade: her life in servitude in exchange for closing the breach. Voshtai watched as Saoirse was unmade, her flesh seeming to rend and tear before flowing to the rift, sealing it with a quivering barrier of skin and muscle that was once Saoirse. 
Cut off from their native plane and source of power, the Fomorians were routed by Gnomish and Cailleotairi reinforcements. 
In the aftermath, Voshtai earned a promotion to Saois.
