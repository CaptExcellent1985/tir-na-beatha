#### Physical Appearance

> Standing at slightly above average height, Aiofe is a slender and non-descript Wood Elf. Her shoulder-length hair is ash blonde and fine, with no apparent curl or waviness to it. Grey eyes scan the world around her, but lack the subtle glimmer that would make them a striking feature. Her smile is muted, and her frown equally so. When others look away from her, it is as if she fades from their memory, her face being a featureless blur if they attempt to recall any thing about her. 

#### Personality

###### Adaptable and Calculated
> Aiofe's personality can change at a moments notice. At first she comes across as flirtatiously innocent, but can adapt as the situation calls for. She tends to hang back and let others do the talking for her, preferring to observe and assess her surroundings. She can quickly take over if she is not getting the results she wants, whether that be orchestrating a line of questioning in an interrogation, or in dispatching of opponents with precision and no hesitation. 
> When the [[Factions/Weave-mothers\|Weave-mothers]] are concerned, Aiofe is zealous in her devotion to them and their cause. She understands that the pursuit of their goals requires evil acts but has come to believe that the ends justify the means. 


#### Biography 

>Aiofe was taken in by the [[Factions/Weave-mothers\|Weave-mothers]] at a younger age than most. Her small village was destroyed by an angry Dryad and her parents killed. A Silk-Matron with the order saved her and brought her to the order, where she was taken in as a Daughter. She developed an aptitude in working with [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Lumina Silk\|Lumina Silk]] and the magic required in the weaving of [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]]. She graduated into the ranks of the Knot-Maidens, and was set to live out the rest of her days this way. One night, however, a member of [[Factions/The Crimson Daggers\|The Crimson Daggers]] broke into her glade and attempted to abscond with some material, and she killed the intruder with no prejudice. The next evening, as she lay asleep, the Imago delivered a grey chord to her and she officially became a member of the Unravellers. 

###### Potential Quotes

> "We were pulled from the same ash, it is true. But she kept the smoke inside her lung, and I exhaled. Do not ask me to spare her because of who we were. Ask me to end her suffering because of who she is."
