#### Physical Appearance

> A slender [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elf]] with matted chestnut brown hair, pale and sickly looking skin. Her eyes are wide and bloodshot, as if she has not slept in ages. She wears the robes of a [[Factions/Weave-mothers\|Weave-mothers]] Daughter, but it has not been properly cared for. It is stained with mud and has begun to fray. A sash made from [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Moonpetal Bloom\|Moonpetal Bloom]] blossoms lays across her torso but it is decaying and petals fall to the ground as she moves. 

#### Personality

###### Obsessive Madness
> Renna loves the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Lumina Moth\|Lumina Moth]] dearly, to the point where it has consumed her life. She speaks in whispers, quickly and as if out of breath. To her, the Moth's are her children and she would willingly die to protect them. She believes that her expulsion from the [[Factions/Weave-mothers\|Weave-mothers]] was a mistake and that they care only for the knots and not the creatures that make them.  She has become delusional, believing her own talents in handling the moths to be greater than even the Triumvirate. When confronted with the tainted nature of counterfeits, she would say something to the effect of "No, no, it's just... they are singing a different song! A louder song! The market just doesn't understand their passion yet."
> 
> She hums constantly—a low, discordant tune (a corrupted version of the Veil-Sisters’ Song of Dormancy) that she thinks calms the moths, but actually makes them erratic.


#### Biography 

> Renna was raised in the same village as [[NPCs/Contemporary/Aoife Coirpeach\|Aoife Coirpeach]] and rescued at the same time. She was a promising Daughter who was set to graduate to the rank of Veil-Sister, but she failed during the Rite of the Chrysalis. During this test, an initiate must watch a [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Lumina Moth\|Lumina Moth]] cocoon for three days and nights without interfering. When a storm swept through the Grove, she used her body to shelter the cocoon and infused it with her own fear and caused the Moth to emerge twisted. She was excommunicated from the [[Factions/Weave-mothers\|Weave-mothers]] but not before she was able to steal several viable cocoons and a pouch of [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Moonpetal Bloom\|Moonpetal Bloom]] seeds. 
> Renna soon fell in with a group of [[Factions/The Crimson Daggers\|The Crimson Daggers]] who quickly recognized her value. They provided her a place to nurture the moths, food, and protection and in return she provides them with [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]]. She believes they are using the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] to help the poor and not flood the market with bad debt. 

###### Potential Quotes

> "Don't look at them! Your gaze is too heavy! You'll bruise their wings!"
> "The Chrysalis didn't care. She would have let them freeze. But I kept them warm. I gave them my own heat."
> "We were supposed to be the same thread, you and I. Two strands in the same cord. When did you become the shears, sister? When did you decide I was the part that needed to be cut?"
> "Do you remember the cellar, Aoife? Do you remember how cold it was? I swore I would never let anything freeze in the dark again. I gave these little ones my warmth because no one was there to give it to us! Don't you dare snuff them out!"
