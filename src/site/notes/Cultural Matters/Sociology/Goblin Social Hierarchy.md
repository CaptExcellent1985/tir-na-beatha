#### Summary
> The Goblin clans operate under a strict social hierarchy based upon 4 distinct castes. The *Lasher's* dominate and lead their clan, while the *Skinners* are responsible for hunting and butchering what little livestock the [[The Tribes/Goblins\|Goblin]] tribe possesses. Muckers are the gatherers of the tribe, providing fruit and vegetables for their people. At the bottom of the social ladder are the *Pariahs*, [[The Tribes/Goblins\|Goblins]] whose ancestry is mired in shame and entire bloodline doomed to traverse the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]] as merchants - to beg and plead other [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] for the goods the surprisingly prideful [[The Tribes/Goblins\|Goblins]] can not provide for themselves.
> 
> Rarely, a *Lasher* who proves to be a very well skilled and clever [[The Tribes/Goblins\|Goblin]] undertakes the *Ritual of Ascendancy.* Upon the successful completion of this ritual, the [[The Tribes/Goblins\|Goblin]] is born anew as a *Hobgoblin* and unites their people into a terrifying force that can upset the balance of power in the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]].
