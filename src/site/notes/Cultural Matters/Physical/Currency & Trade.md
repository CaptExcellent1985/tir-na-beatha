#### Summary
> The trading currency of all [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] is referred to as "knots". Woven from the silk of the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Lumina Moth\|Lumina Moth]], the value of each knot is determined by the complexity of the weave-work. The most basic unit is the *single knot*, scaling from there to the *double*, the *square*, and finally the *eternity knot*. The most common unit amongst the traders of the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]] is the *square knot*, while the *single* and *double knot* are the units that most day-to-day business is conducted with.

###### Unique Properties
> Knots are made from the silk of the Lumina Moth. This unique material is fine and soft in texture, and it fluoresces and shifts colours when exposed to emotional energy. It is this unique magical property of the silk that makes it a suitable material for currency, as duplicating this makes the creation of counterfeit knots extremely difficult, if not impossible.

###### Dark Knots
> During the life-cycle of a knot, it is exposed to a wide-range of emotional energy. Typically, the ritual that balances a knot prior to being released into circulation ensures the integrity of the knot through its lifecycle. However, knots that have taken on too many violent emotions become corrupted and can, in turn, corrupt [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] that come to possess them. The affected knot, if detected, must be cleansed and taken out of circulation. The presence of dark knots in large quantities can be used as an indicator that war is on the horizon. 

#### DM's Notes
- Create sub-headings for the relation between the governance of [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]], and the [[Factions/Weave-mothers\|Weave-mothers]]
