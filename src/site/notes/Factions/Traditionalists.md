#### Summary
> The Dwarven Traditionalists are a decentralized and underground movement dedicated to preserving the "Old Ways" of their people. This philosophy is built on the belief that true order is something to be carefully crafted, that order can not be imposed. Prior to the rise of the [[Factions/Ord Directorate\|Ord Directorate]], they led the Dwarves in a democracy guided by the elected High Bench, where the Gaisce, Major and Faoi clans were considered equal pillars of a shared community. They value consensus, deep rooted honour, and the deliberate and slow pursuit of mastery of their craft. They believe in a strict symbiosis with nature. To a Traditionalist, a tree planter is just as important as the lumberjack. 
> 
> Stripped of their leadership during the massacre of the [[History/Night of Shattered Shields\|Night of Shattered Shields]], they now operate without a formal hierarchy. They remain bound together through the passage of ancestral heirlooms and the mantra "Deep roots hold firm". 

#### Core Values
> Traditionalists follow the Old Ways of the Dwarves. They stand in contrast to the Ord Directorate, which has changed Dwarven society into one where authority is a ladder and mastery over others is a virtue. They fear that the mass extraction of resources upsets the balance and strengthens the Anord, and that mass production devalues Dwarven crafting traditions developed over centuries. 

###### Order is Crafted
> Dwarven Traditionalists believe that peace, prosperity, and stability are not achieved in a day. They approach these goals much like they do their master works. A Dwarven artisan would rather spend a year crafting the perfect piece of furniture or tool than rush it and create something that breaks in a day. To a Traditionalist, the brutal control exerted by [[NPCs/Contemporary/Torin Iron-Heart\|Torin]] and his Directorate is brittle and would shatter under the slightest amount of pressure. 

###### Deep Roots Hold Firm
> Traditionalists hold to deep bonds between Clans and others. To them, these bonds strengthen the unity of their people and create resilient communities that can hold against what ever challenges the Tir may present to them. A Dwarf should always seek to help another Dwarf or their allies. 

###### Harmony is Balance
> The Old Ways call for balance in all things. This is evident in traditional Dwarven justice, and in the way that they do honor to nature and the land they call home. There can and should be no extraction of resources without finding a suitable way to pay back or replace what is taken. 

###### Consensus is King
> Dwarven Traditionalists hold to the old ways of making decisions, in which understanding is developed through conversation and respectful debate. This fosters trust and respect between parties, and leads to a deepening of the bonds between them. 

#### Hierarchy
> The Traditionalists lack a formal hierarchical structure or organization. To be a Traditionalist requires only that a Dwarf honours the Old Ways and to resist the Ord Directorate where possible. Groups of like-minded Dwarf's may exist, but it is rare to find any that would identify themselves as a Traditionalist openly. 

#### History
###### War of Summer's Favour
> In the early days of their history, the Dwarves sought domination over the land. They believed that in gaining the upper hand against the Fey, and other Tuatha, they could eliminate the threat posed by the Anord and impose a lasting peace. Their defeat during the War of Summer's Favour showed them that others would always resist, and that order through force was only an illusion and could break in a moment. As Dwarven carpentry techniques advanced in complexity, they realized that true mastery came from learning about and working with each individual piece of wood and began to apply this concept to diplomacy. 



###### The Thread-Breaker's War
> During the chaotic years of the Thread-Breakers War, the Traditionalists found their ideals of balance severely tested. Dwarven lands were besieged on two fronts by Wood Elf warbands and the very Tiefling exiles the Traditionalists had secretly aided in the past. Blindsided by the disastrous Rune-Breach Folly caused by their Gnomish allies in the Cogswyr Syndicate, the faction turned away from further martial escalation and leaned heavily into their diplomatic roots. Relying on the Cailleotairi for reinforcement, the Traditionalist leaders used their influence within the Dwarven delegation to champion these neutral warriors as the official peacekeepers of the realm. True to their belief in consensus and harmony, it was the Traditionalists who successfully argued for the foundational tenet of the Weave-Mothers Peace: that despite their differences, all Tuatha share a common heritage and must prioritize the stability of the Tir above the ambitions of any single tribe.

###### Discovery of Iron
> When the [[The Tribes/Lizard-folk\|Lizard-folk]] discovered iron in the [[Geography/Region/Draigsreach Peninsula\|Draigsreach Peninsula]], the Dwarven Traditionalists were deeply cautious. While other craftsmen rushed to set up trade routes and forge these new, fey-harming weapons, the Traditionalists hesitated. They understood the value of iron, but believed that taking such a powerful gift from the earth required finding a way to repay the land and maintain balance. Unfortunately, their warnings were ignored by the rest of their people. As the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]] began blockading the iron trade out of anger over this corruption of nature, the Traditionalists could only watch as the rising tensions paved the way for the War of the Severed Root.

###### War of the Severed Root and the Treaty of Green Ash
> During the War of the Severed Root, the Traditionalists watched their worst fears materialize. Their earlier warnings about the unchecked expansion of the iron and logging trades were completely ignored, leading directly to a brutal guerrilla war with the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]] over the desecration of [[Geography/Region/Fossmore Forest\|Fossmore Forest]]. When the war turned against the Dwarves and the vital hub of [[Geography/City/Tre Coedwig\|Tre Coedwig]] was captured, the Traditionalist leaders of the Major Clans saw a necessary opportunity to end the bloodshed. Prioritizing ecological balance over industrial greed, they overrode the objections of military leaders like [[NPCs/Contemporary/Torin Iron-Heart\|Torin Iron-Heart]] and quickly signed the [[History/Treaty of Green Ash\|Treaty of Green Ash]]. They accepted the strict logging embargoes and territorial losses in a desperate bid to restore harmony to the land. However, this pragmatic surrender cost them dearly; their willingness to yield gave Torin the exact political ammunition he needed to brand the Old Guard as weak, setting the stage for his fiery populist uprising.

###### The Night of Shattered Shields
> During the [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Rogue Scholar's Crisis]] of 1575, the Traditionalist leaders sent their forces to aid their [[The Tribes/Gnomes\|Gnomish]] allies. [[NPCs/Contemporary/Torin Iron-Heart\|Torin Iron-Heart]] used their absence to strike. He marched his loyalist forces into [[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]] and executed the remaining Traditionalist leaders of the Major Clans—specifically those who had not already been forced out through his rigged elections. This massacre became known as the [[History/Night of Shattered Shields\|Night of Shattered Shields]]. With their leadership wiped out and Torin's loyalists installed in their place to form the [[Factions/Ord Directorate\|Ord Directorate]], the Traditionalists were stripped of their political power. Today, they are forced to operate entirely in the shadows as an underground resistance.
