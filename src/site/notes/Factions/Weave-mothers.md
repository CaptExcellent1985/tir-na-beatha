#### Summary
> The Weave-mothers care for the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Lumina Moth\|Lumina Moth]] and the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Moonpetal Bloom\|Moonpetal Bloom]] on which it feeds. They are responsible for cultivating the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Lumina Silk\|Lumina Silk]] and weaving it into the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] that serves as the currency for the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]]. The Weave-Mothers are well trained in druidic magic, as well as alchemy and enchanting and possess a matronly demeanor towards both the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Lumina Moth\|Lumina Moth]] and the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]]. Because of the sensitivity required to raise the moth's and coax them into producing their valuable silk, only the Weave-mothers are permitted to handle them. 
> 
> Overseen by the Triumvirate of the Weave, they also oversee the management of the burgeoning economy of the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]]. Silk-Matron's serve as bankers and economic advisors, ensuring the value of the knot is consistent for all and that no one tribe, guild, or [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] hoards their wealth and halts the free-flow of trade and commerce. They maintain an easy alliance with the [[Factions/Council of Aite-Briethe\|Council of Aite-Briethe]] and the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] in the pursuit of their goals of a equitable future for all. 

#### Core Values
> The core belief and guiding principle of the Weave-Mothers is that "Trust is Woven". They believe the complexity of diplomatic relations is symbolized within the weave of their [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] and that peace is promoted and maintained through a stable and centralized unit of trade. 
> 
> Weave-Mothers find their membership amongst those [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] who embody the feminine spirit of the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]] and seek to nurture. Through the practicing of druidic rituals, members form an empathetic relationship between themselves, the Groves and the Moths. Enchanting techniques passed on through the [[The Tribes/Feyfolk\|Fey]] and the [[The Tribes/Gnomes\|Gnomes]] extend this relationship to the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Lumina Silk\|Lumina Silk]] and [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] they produce. [[The Tribes/Kobolds\|Kobold]] and [[The Tribes/Firbolg\|Firbolg]] alchemical understanding is taught and applied to ensure a bountiful harvest.

###### Triumvirate of the Weave
> The Weave-Mothers are governed by a council of three, the wisest and most motherly of their order.  Each has an equal voice within the Triumvirate and no decision is final until consensus is achieved. They maintain an alliance with the [[Factions/Council of Aite-Briethe\|Council of Aite-Briethe]], and the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]], while holding strict control over the economic health of the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]]. 
> 
> The Chrysalis is seen as being one with the Grove and the Moth and their pain is her pain. She is gifted with the ability to root out sickness before it can spread, and sense when environmental factors in the region will negatively impact the health and well-being of her charges. 
> 
> The Filament is possessed of a keen eye for detail, and is the chief auditor of quality for all silk and [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] produced. She also leads the final ritual that enhances and balances the emotional resonance of [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] before they enter circulation, ensuring that equilibrium is imbued in each. 
> 
> The Imago is the cold and calculating one, overseeing the stability of [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] once they have entered trade. She abhors those who would hoard wealth, viewing the free-flow of [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] similar to the flow of water, with pools stagnating and inviting disease. She alone wields the Unraveller's as one wields a dagger, pruning corrupted [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] before they can rot the core. 

#### History
###### [[History/First Lumina Harvest\|First Lumina Harvest]]
> Circa 1000 ATT, a [[The Tribes/Halflings\|Halfling]] druid by the name of [[NPCs/Historical/Larkfoot\|Larkfoot]] discovered relationship between the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Moonpetal Bloom\|Moonpetal Bloom]] and the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Lumina Moth\|Lumina Moth]]. With her unique connection to the area that would later become the Lumina Grove, [[NPCs/Historical/Larkfoot\|Larkfoot]] developed a set of rituals and practices to nurture that relationship and provide a reliable and bountiful harvest of silk. Recognizing the unique property of the silk, she began to weave it into [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] and worked with those overseeing the resettlement of [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]] to promote it as a standard unit of trade. 

###### [[History/The Triton Matriarch's Charter\|The Triton Matriarch's Charter]]
> As the [[The Tribes/Tritons\|Tritons]] were beginning to strengthen their hold over the riverways of the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]], they saw value in using [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] for the collection of tolls. With the signing of the Charter in 1011 ATT, the [[The Tribes/Tritons\|Triton]] Matriarch's formally adopted the knot as the only unit of trade accepted, giving more weight to the Weave-Mothers and [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]]. 

###### [[History/The Weave-Mother's Peace\|The Weave-Mother's Peace]]
> At the conclusion of [[History/The Thread-Breaker's War\|The Thread-Breaker's War]], the Weave-Mothers were instrumental in negotiating peace between the tribes. They persuasively argued for the creation of the [[Factions/Council of Aite-Briethe\|Council of Aite-Briethe]], the recognition of a shared-heritage amongst the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]], and that the adoption of a centralized and stable currency would help to keep the peace. The knot became the formal currency in the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]] and the Weave-Mother's authority over all stages of it's creation established.
