#### Summary

>  The **Cailleotairi** serve as the stoic backbone of **[[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]] Na Beatha**, functioning not only as elite defenders against supernatural threats but also as impartial arbiters among the diverse [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] tribes. Because their loyalty lies with the realm itself rather than any single chieftain or lineage, they are uniquely positioned to negotiate treaties, resolve inter-tribal disputes, and enforce the peace. Whether standing against incursions from the Feywild or mediating a blood feud between clans, the Cailleotairi represent a higher law, ensuring stability across the region from their fortress at **[[Geography/Locale/Siorlann\|Siorlann]]**.
>  
> Internally, the Order is defined by a rigorous hierarchy of merit and mentorship. *Foghlaimi* are trained by veteran *Saois* to be as skilled in diplomacy as they are in combat. Once they survive the "[[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|Proving]]" and swear the [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Verdant Oath\|Verdant Oath]], they form autonomous squadrons called *Laochra*. These units are granted immense freedom to handle crises as they see fit, trusted to balance the delicate politics of the tribes while holding the line against the darkness that threatens to swallow them all



#### Core Values
> Guided by the [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Verdant Oath\|Verdant Oath]], the Cailleotairi hold as their core values that of Duty, Honour, and Unity.  They see themselves as the neutral arbiters of the peace and believe that the continued survival of the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] can be achieved through unity and the recognition of a shared culture and ancestry between the Tribes. They extend this belief to their dealings with the various fey spirits that inhabit the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]] and seek a balance that honours both [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] and Fey. 
> 
> Although often-times giving council to chieftains and other leaders, their [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Verdant Oath\|Verdant Oath]] binds them to the defense of the common folk - those who cannot defend themselves against the ravages of [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|The Anord]] or war. Trust is paramount to the Cailleotairi. When joining, a [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] renounces all ties to their tribe or their homeland, so they may be seen as uncorrupted by lineage.  Once deployed, the *Laochra* is the supreme authority in their theatre of operation. They are given the autonomy to solve problems as they see fit, provided the outcome serves the greater good. 
> 
> A Cailleotairi is expected to be a master of their craft - a cut above the rest of the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]]. Whether through blade, spell, or intuition, a Cailleotairi without the necessary skill to uphold their authority is doomed to fail in their [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Verdant Oath\|Verdant Oath]]. Through [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|The Proving]] a Cailleotairi recruit demonstrates this mastery and earns the trust that is placed in them.

#### History
###### Early History
> In the aftermath of [[Religion/Myths & Legends/The Telling\|The Telling]] and as the [[02 - Tuatha\|Proto-Tuatha]] Elders awoke at the foot of [[Geography/Locale/Siorlann\|Siorlann]], they began to explore the strange land they had found themselves in. They had no memory of what had come before and were like children left to their own devices. [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|The Anord]] sowed chaotic unpredictability, with seasons changing in the span of an instant and the very terrain shifting just as suddenly. Many [[02 - Tuatha\|Proto-Tuatha]] who strayed far from the area that would become [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]] were lost and never found again.
> 
> Those who bravely struck out into the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]] soon became renowned for their skill in navigating and adapting to the chaos and soon formed a loose coalition of hunters and guides. Over the course of several decades this coalition would often find themselves drawn to leadership roles amongst the [[02 - Tuatha\|Proto-Tuatha]] and would serve as the roots for what would become the Cailleotairi. 
> 
> During [[History/The Sundering Plague\|The Sundering Plague]] the coalition would serve as the sole link between the branching off [[02 - Tuatha\|Proto-Tuatha]], keeping lines of communication and trade open and where necessary dealing with capricious Fey spirits. When the [[History/War of Summer's Favour\|War of Summer's Favour]] broke out in 155 ATT, the coalition adopted the name of Cailleotairi and distinguished themselves by aiding refugees and delivering diplomatic messages between the warring tribes. 
> 
> Cailleotairi look to four primary figures from this time-frame as the "founders" of their order. They are revered for their long-term legacy and for the lives they saved during the War. 
> - [[NPCs/Historical/Eibhear Glasan\|Eibhear Glasan]], known as The Sage, was an Eladrin noble who organized the initial refugee convoys, drafted the first versions of [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Verdant Oath\|The Verdant Oath]], and believed that allegiance to ones tribe was a shackle and argued extensively for the neutrality of the Cailleotairi. 
> - [[NPCs/Historical/Thorgunn Oak-knuckle\|Thorgunn Oak-knuckle]], named The Shield, was a Dwarf who grew disillusioned with Clan Ceardaigh and their attempts to impose order. She bore first-hand witness to [[History/The Rimeblast\|The Rimeblast]] and quickly joined the refugee caravans as a protector. She was instrumental in teaching future Cailleotairi defensive techniques, like the use of the shield wall, and would often position herself between assailants and the innocent. 
> - [[NPCs/Historical/Kallista Cinderwind\|Kallista Cinderwind]], a Tiefling Sorceress who became known as The Fulcrum. She would constantly risk her life to cross the battle-lines to negotiate the safe passage of the refugee's and was a distinguished diplomat who believed in balance between the tribes. Her close friendship with [[NPCs/Historical/Thorgunn Oak-knuckle\|Thorgunn Oak-knuckle]] was seen as proof that intense tribal rivalries could be over-come. 
> - Torran Willowspeak, known as The Root, was a Firbolg hunter, ranger, and survivalist. He believed the the connection between the land, the [[The Tribes/Feyfolk\|Fey]] and the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] was innate and the key to peace. He taught the Cailleotairi how to seek out the path between leaves, to move through the forest, and how to read the signs of nature to predict the often unpredictable [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|Anord]]. 

###### Formalization of the Order
> In the year 275 ATT, Cailleotairi Ranger's played a significant role in the [[History/Binding of the First Scions\|Binding of the First Scions]]. It was a Cailleotairi who first recognized the prophecy of [[NPCs/Historical/The Cardinal Echo\|The Cardinal Echo]], who would then go on to form the first *Laochra* to unite the First Scions and formulate the binding ritual. This *Laochra* was also responsible for forging the alliance with the Summer Queen and convincing her of the necessity of the binding. 
> 
> The following year, this *Laochra* would formally organize the Cailleotairi into the order it is to this day. They established the hierarchy that would govern them, developed [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|The Proving]] as the fundamental rite of passage of all Cailleotairi, and bound all agents to the [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Verdant Oath\|Verdant Oath]]. The Tribal leaders, recognizing the key role the Cailleotairi played in securing and maintaining the stability of [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|The Anord]], agreed to invest the Cailleotairi with the authority needed to ensure peace and prosperity wherever they may go. 

###### Rise in Prominence
>  Over the following centuries, Cailleotairi agents would work ceaselessly in the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]]. Many wars between Tribes were prevented thanks to Cailleotairi diplomacy, and where they could not be avoided Cailleotairi efforts saved countless lives. Fey spirits, known for their alien and capricious natures, were appeased or neutralized, and Cailleotairi guides protected [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] travelling the forests of the [[Tir Na Beatha Leaflet\|Tir]]. 
>  
>  Their reputation as skilled guides was further solidified with the [[History/Discovery of the Second Sight Codex\|Discovery of the Second Sight Codex]], which added to an already complex set of navigational principles that could apply whether [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|The Anord]] co-operated or not. In the 6th Century ATT, as [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] began to migrate and reclaim their lost birth-place of [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]], the Cailleotairi saw this as an opportunity to establish a central base of operations. Hiring the best craftsmen of the [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] and [[The Tribes/Gnomes\|Gnomes]], they built and established the [[Geography/Locale/Cailleotairi Enclave\|Cailleotairi Enclave]] in the area of [[Geography/Locale/Cruachan Heights\|Cruachan Heights]]. 
>  
>  Caillotairi intervention in the [[History/Last Warg-King's Crusade\|Last Warg-King's Crusade]] saved the [[The Tribes/Goblins\|Goblins]] from being decimated by an alliance of [[The Tribes/Twilight Elves\|Twilight Elves]] and [[The Tribes/Firbolg\|Firbolg]]. They were early defenders of the [[Factions/Weave-mothers\|Weave-mothers]], and played a role in convincing the [[The Tribes/Tritons\|Tritons]] Matriarch's of the value of [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] as a standard currency.  This lead to [[History/The Triton Matriarch's Charter\|The Triton Matriarch's Charter]] and a strengthened [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]] which would cause tensions that culminated in [[History/The Thread-Breaker's War\|The Thread-Breaker's War]]. 
>  

###### [[History/The Thread-Breaker's War\|The Thread-Breaker's War]], and the [[History/The Weave-Mother's Peace\|The Weave-Mother's Peace]]
> [[History/The Thread-Breaker's War\|The Thread-Breaker's War]] was the closest the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] had ever come to annihilating themselves. The machinations of [[NPCs/Historical/Lord Tarsus\|Lord Tarsus]] were eventually halted by a Cailleotairi *Laochra* who defeated him and his crown guard in battle. Cailleotairi diplomats, in conjunction with the [[Factions/Weave-mothers\|Weave-mothers]] and the governing council of [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]] brought the tribes together to negotiate [[History/The Weave-Mother's Peace\|The Weave-Mother's Peace]]. This saw the formal recognition of [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]] as the economic and cultural capital of the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]], the Cailleotairi as the official and neutral peace-keeping force that would uphold law and security, and the formal adoption of the [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] as the central trading currency. 

###### [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Rogue Scholar's Crisis]]
> In 1575, Cailleotairi played a significant role in ending the [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Rogue Scholar's Crisis]]. Hundreds of agents were called to defend [[Geography/City/Cogswyr\|Cogswyr]] from the increasingly destabilized [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|Anord]] and it was a famous *Laochra* known as "The Sinking Stone" who worked hand-in-hand with Chief Artificer [[NPCs/Contemporary/Whirligig\|Whirligig]] to develop the stabilizing loci. The event culminated in the [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Fomorian Breach]], where all save for two members of the *Laochra* were killed in action or went missing. Newly appoint *Saois* [[NPCs/Contemporary/Voshtai\|Voshtai]] was responsible for bringing [[NPCs/Contemporary/Whirligig\|Whirligig]] to justice, an event which weakened the power of the [[Factions/Cogswyr Syndicate\|Cogswyr Syndicate]] and lead to the unofficial recognition of the [[Factions/Eolian Scribes\|Eolian Scribes]] as the official leaders of the [[The Tribes/Gnomes\|Gnome]] clans. As such, many [[The Tribes/Gnomes\|gnomes]] allied with the [[Factions/Cogswyr Syndicate\|Cogswyr Syndicate]] view Cailleotairi with distrust.
