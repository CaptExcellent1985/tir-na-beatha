They traveled upstream on [[Geography/Landmark/Cleverclaw Creek\|Cleverclaw Creek]] with the assistance of a [[The Tribes/Tritons\|Triton]] Boatman and encountered a shimmering presence in the forest before [[The Campaign/PCs/Themaer Eagerflower\|Themaer Eagerflower]] had a playful interaction with a Fairy Dragon, who returned stolen [[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]] and gifted a Scroll of Comprehend Languages. 

Upon discovering the Hidden Citadel, the group explored the ruins, including a tower filled with expired bird feed and a Laboratory with strange lights and chemical labels.

They then found an office with a glowing tablet that discussed consciousness and a figure named “Elizabeth.” After climbing to the third level, they encountered gremlins trapped in glass tubes, which they freed. The gremlins revealed that a tall figure had visited previously and taken something from the central Cube-Within-A-Cube. 

The party located a hidden cache in the forest containing valuable items, including Starfire Rhapsody Wine and a Cloak of Billowing. They divided the treasure and decided to return to camp for rest before continuing their exploration and reporting on their findings at the Hidden Citadel. 



## Key Moments
### The Final Blow to the Animated Armor
[[The Campaign/PCs/Koldea\|Koldea]] strikes the Animated Armor's knee with her Morningstar, sending metal shards flying.
