They aimed to secure weapons and traps to combat [[The Tribes/Goblins\|goblin]] raids affecting [[The Tribes/Firbolg\|Firbolg]] settlements.

In the **[[Geography/Locale/Scaled Market\|Scaled Market]]**, the party interacted with various merchants, including **Snarl-Dreg**, a [[The Tribes/Goblins\|goblin]] merchant, and **Nala**, a [[The Tribes/Tabaxi\|tabaxi]] merchant.

The party also discovered that **Ashlika**, a skilled trapper, had been taken by the **Dark Elves** to the **Deadlands** after a dispute. **[[The Campaign/PCs/Koldea\|Koldea]]** took a mislabeled love potion from **Snarl-Dreg** and led the group to the **[[Geography/Locale/Ember-Belly Inn\|Ember-Belly Inn]]** to gather more information.
