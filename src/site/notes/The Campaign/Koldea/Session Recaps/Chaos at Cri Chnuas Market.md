## Session Summary
The session began with **Exploder**, **Koldea**, and **Themaer Eagerflower** traveling by boat along **Cleverclaw Creek** toward the kobold city of **Cri Chnuas** in the **Wellandrym Vale**. They aimed to secure weapons and traps to combat goblin raids affecting Firbolg settlements. Upon arrival, they encountered a **Triton Ferryman** who guided them through the city’s creek tunnel system, where they learned about the market and its trade dynamics.

In the **Scaled Market**, the party interacted with various merchants, including **Snarl-Dreg**, a goblin merchant, and **Nala**, a tabaxi merchant. They attempted to barter for goods but faced challenges, including a refusal from **Nala** to accept textiles in exchange for her wares. The party also discovered that **Ashlika**, a skilled trapper, had been taken by the **Dark Elves** to the **Deadlands** after a dispute. **Koldea** took a mislabeled love potion from **Snarl-Dreg** and led the group to the **Ember-Belly Inn** to gather more information.

At the inn, they met **Spark Scale**, the proprietor, who provided insights about **Malachite**, an eladrin with shifting tattoos. A chaotic incident ensued when a **Ruddy Cheeks McGee** caused a wild magic surge, summoning dust mephits that attacked patrons. The party engaged in combat, successfully defeating the mephits and subduing the drake without killing it. Afterward, they learned from **Spark Scale** that **Malachite** had passed through **Cri Chnuas** months prior and was rumored to be heading toward the **Hidden Citadel**.

The session concluded with **Spark Scale** offering a trade for relics recovered from the **Hidden Citadel** and providing a map to its location. The party planned to pursue **Malachite** while preparing for their next steps in the ongoing conflict against the goblins and the mysteries surrounding the eladrin.



## Key Moments
### Arrival at the Scaled Market
The currents of Cleverclaw Creek guide the trio through shadowy caverns, with the Triton Ferryman at the helm. Water laps against stone walls as they approach the driftwood docks beneath Scaled Market. The Triton announces, "Matriarchs Rest." Do they disembark to explore the vibrant market or stay in the boat, soaking in the sights and sounds of Cri Chnuas? The air buzzes with kobold energy, promising adventure.

### Koldea's Trade Recommendations in Cri Chnuas
The trade zones of Cri Chnuas buzz with stalls and merchants. Koldea highlights "Sticks 'n' Things," featuring kobold armor, and the "Scaled Market," offering deals with his name. Sorn can enhance powers at the "Clutch of the Arcane." Koldea's excitement builds anticipation. Choices await: where will you go first? "We're going to get you so jacked those cog thieves won't know what hit them."

### Exploder's Deceptive Lure
The boat rocked as Exploder mimicked fish splashes and his companions' voices. He called out in Goblin, "Hey, what's taking so long?"
