#### Description
>*The moss is damp beneath my fingers, the bark rough against my cheek. I write by the glow of a captured firefly, its flickering light a frantic dance mirroring the chaos in my skull. Another day, another cycle of gnawing hunger and the echoing laughter of memory. I used to be Thalin, a [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] of the Wood, a protector. Now… now I am just a shadow, a whisper in the wind, a tooth in the dark.*
>*[[NPCs/Contemporary/Malachite\|Malachite]]. Ha! His name is a delicious poison on my tongue. Those tattoos, they didn't shift like mist, they writhed, like hungry worms in fresh meat. He listened, he understood… oh, he understood me better than I understood myself. He didn't just feed the doubts, he cultivated them, watered them with his sweet, deceptive words, until they choked out everything else. My worries, the ones that gnawed at me like a rat in a granary since… since Petal.* 
>*Petal. My sweet, sweet Petal. Her eyes, bright as forest pools. But those eyes… they weren't hers, were they? Not when the changeling wore her skin. The memory of striking it down, of seeing its true, alien form, it doesn't rip at my gut anymore. No, it’s a cold, sharp blade of triumph. That act, that terrible, glorious act, was what brought me to [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|the Proving]], what proved my worth, what earned me my rank among the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]]. But my love, she never forgave me. She saw only the act, not the monstrous lie, not the strength it took to tear out the cancer. That wound, it didn't fester; it simply opened, a gaping maw for [[NPCs/Contemporary/Malachite\|Malachite]] to fill with his truth.*
>*He didn't just tell me the merchants were judging me, he showed me their sneering faces behind their false smiles. He didn't just say my own [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] questioned my judgment, he let me hear their whispers, their jealous resentments, their fear of my cold, clear sight. My fears, the ones I confessed in the false intimacy of the campfire, were not just valid, they were the truth! And they became so gloriously real, didn't they? My paranoia, my deepest terrors, they coalesced, a twisting knot of shadows, of teeth, in my mind until… until I struck out at the real threat.*
>*I see their faces still, not terror, but betrayal in the caravan guards, and the stupid, blind sorrow in my own kin’s eyes as they fought me off. Fools! They didn't understand. I didn't want to hurt them, no, I wanted to save them! From themselves! From the rot that [[NPCs/Contemporary/Malachite\|Malachite]] had shown me. But the whispers… [[NPCs/Contemporary/Malachite\|Malachite]]'s whispers… they weren't just loud, they were my own voice, finally free! They told me I was alone, yes, because I was the only one who truly saw. Everyone else was against me, yes, because they were blind, weak, and would betray me, just as Petal had been replaced, just as my heart had been torn apart and rebuilt, stronger, clearer.*
>*Now I roam. The forest, once my sanctuary, is my hunting ground. Every rustle of leaves, every snapped twig, is not a threat, but an opportunity. I set my snares, silent and unseen. And I eat what I catch. Anything. The deer, the rabbits, the occasional lost traveler… they are all just meat, fuel for this sharpened perception. Hunger is a constant companion now, a blunt instrument that clears the doubt from my mind, leaving only the pure, cold clarity.*
>*A monster? Perhaps. The [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] code, the reverence for life, it's a child's fable. I have ascended. Sometimes, when the moon is full and the night is still, I see her face. Petal. Not the changeling, no, but my true daughter. And I hear my love’s weeping. It’s a distant hum now, a soft melody in the background of my glorious freedom.*
>*I wonder if they still hunt me. Let them. Let them try to grasp what [[NPCs/Contemporary/Malachite\|Malachite]] has given me. He didn't just peel back the layers of my grief; he flayed me, and in that raw, exposed state, he allowed me to truly see. He didn't devour me; he unveiled me. He showed me the truth. And for that… for that, I am almost… grateful.*
