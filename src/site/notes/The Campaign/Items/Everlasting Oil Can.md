#### Description

>This ornately carved oil can, made from a polished elderwood and a hollowed mountain goat horn as a spout, holds an ever-refilling reservoir of magical oil. One application of this oil to any axe or saw provides a full day's worth of smooth operation, reducing the risk of jams and increasing cutting efficiency. It never needs refilling, but loses its magic if damaged beyond repair.
>
>**Property:** When applied to an axe or saw, +5 to hit against wooden objects.
