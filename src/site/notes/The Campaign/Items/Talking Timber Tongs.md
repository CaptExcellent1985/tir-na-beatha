#### Description

> *These sturdy tongs are crafted from enchanted ironwood. When activated (bonus action), they speak in a gruff voice, identifying the type of wood being grasped (oak, pine, etc.) and offering warnings about potential hidden knots or cracks within the wood. These tongs are immensely helpful for lumberjacks assessing the quality and safety of trees before felling them.*
> 
> **Charges:** 4 - regains 1d4 uses after a long rest. 
> 
> **Property (Speak with Wood):** When used on a piece of wood, you can speak to it, much like a speak with animals spell.
