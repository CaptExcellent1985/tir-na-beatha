## Session Summary
The party returned to **[[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]]**, approaching the city with the tower of **[[Geography/Locale/Siorlann\|Siorlann]]** visible above the forest. As they crossed the **Chandler Ross Memorial Bridge**, a mysterious whisper echoed in their minds. In the bustling market district of **[[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]]**, they encountered various creatures including **[[The Tribes/Goblins\|goblin]]** [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/Goblin Social Hierarchy\|pariahs]], **[[The Tribes/Tabaxi\|tabaxi]]** merchants, **[[The Tribes/Kobolds\|kobolds]]**, and **[[The Tribes/Tritons\|tritons]]** selling their wares. They made their way to **Ranger’s Rest**, a tavern favored by the **[[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]]**, where they noticed a fenced park and a magical pond nearby.

At the stables behind the tavern, a loud yell prompted the party to investigate **Charlie**, **[[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]]**’s donkey. Suddenly, the doors burst open, revealing the corpse of an **[[The Tribes/Eladrin\|Eladrin]]** stablehand, which was soon followed by several grotesque, tentacled creatures known as “malleables.” The party engaged in combat with the malleables, with **[[The Campaign/PCs/Sorn Talabrina\|Sorn]]** firing arrows, **[[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]]** casting spells, and **Kroc-gar** using his sword **Bas** to cleave through the creatures. Amidst the chaos, civilians fled, and the malleables merged into a larger creature.

The battle continued inside **Ranger’s Rest**, where the party and guards fought against the malleables. After a series of attacks, **[[The Campaign/PCs/Grix Gildred\|Grix]]** landed a final blow, bringing down the creature. Following the fight, **[[NPCs/Contemporary/Voshtai\|Voshtai]]**, a lizardfolk leader, demanded to know what the party had brought with them. The group reported on their previous mission, revealing information about **[[NPCs/Contemporary/Malachite\|Malachite]]** and the **Dagda Circle**. **Brocc Hedker**, **[[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]]**’s estranged brother, entered the tavern, claiming their mother was alive and urging **[[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]]** to join the **Treasair's**.

The session concluded with the party receiving a bonus from **[[NPCs/Contemporary/Voshtai\|Voshtai]]** and discussing various crises affecting the region, including missing [[The Tribes/Firbolg\|firbolg]] villagers and a call for aid from **[[Geography/City/Luckbarrow\|Luckbarrow]]**. They were tasked with choosing their next mission while maintaining peace among the **Tuatha** and investigating the ongoing threats posed by **[[NPCs/Contemporary/Malachite\|Malachite]]** and the malleables.
