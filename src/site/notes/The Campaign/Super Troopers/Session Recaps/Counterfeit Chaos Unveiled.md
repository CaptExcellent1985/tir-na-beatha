## Session Summary
The session began with a debriefing in the **[[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]]** tower at **[[Geography/Locale/Siorlann\|Siorlann]]**, where **[[NPCs/Contemporary/Voshtai\|Voshtai]]**, **Elowen Moonshadow**, a [[The Tribes/Firbolg\|Firbolg]] druid of the **Dagda Grove**, and **Aerin Silverleaf** of **The [[Factions/Eolian Scribes\|Eolian Scribes]]** informed the party about the current state of affairs. **[[NPCs/Contemporary/Voshtai\|Voshtai]]** explained that **[[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]]** forces were stretched thin across the **[[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]]** due to a decline in [[Cultural Matters/Sociology/The Proving\|Proving]] recruits and ongoing deployments. He authorized the party to deputize temporary **[[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]]** members as needed, albeit with limited benefits.

The discussion continued with **[[NPCs/Contemporary/Voshtai\|Voshtai]]** recapping the group's previous encounter at **Ranger’s Rest**, where they defeated malleables. **Elowen Moonshadow** warned of instability in the **[[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|Anord]]**, the magical chaos of the **[[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]]**, which had begun to show signs of unrest. The party was reminded of the riddle on a door found beneath **Uldrick**, a cannibal cleric [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|dwarf]], and **Aerin Silverleaf** mentioned ongoing research into unlocking that door.

After a week of downtime in **[[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]]**, the party reconvened in the **Market District**. They encountered a [[The Tribes/Halflings\|halfling]] in despair, which was interrupted by a [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|wood elf]] named **Aoife**, who identified counterfeit **[[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]]** that projected despair. **Aoife**, a Knot Maiden of the **Weave Mothers**, requested the party's help in investigating the source of these counterfeits, promising to advocate for them with her organization.

The session concluded with the party agreeing to investigate the **Crimson Daggers**, a group rumored to be involved with the counterfeit **[[Cultural Matters/Physical/Currency & Trade\|knots]]**, and to explore the **River District** and sewers for leads. They were set to pursue this new objective as the session ended in **The Rain Barrel** tavern, where they gathered information from **[[NPCs/Contemporary/Tekia The Silent\|Tekia the Silent]]** about the **Crimson Daggers** and their operations in the area.



## Key Moments
### [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] Authorization and Malleable Threats
In the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] tower, [[NPCs/Contemporary/Voshtai\|Voshtai]] and Elowen Moonshadow disclose their forces' dire state. The emergence of malleables allows the party to recruit temporary allies, leading to Kroc-gar's jest about a cheeky [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|dwarf]] and playful banter from [[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]] and [[The Campaign/PCs/Sorn Talabrina\|Sorn]].

Overwhelmed by a furious [[The Tribes/Goblins\|goblin]] opponent, he is left battered. [[The Tribes/Goblins\|Goblin]] overseers, intrigued by his audacity, invite him back for more fights.

He remembers Kozok the Broken Gaze, the lizardfolk wizard forever changed after returning from the tower in 1520, transforming it into a harbinger of dread. Weighing the risks, he knows the path leads past the [[Geography/City/Bone Cairn\|Bone Cairn]] by the Tiriosann. Will he confront the tower's sinister allure or turn back?
