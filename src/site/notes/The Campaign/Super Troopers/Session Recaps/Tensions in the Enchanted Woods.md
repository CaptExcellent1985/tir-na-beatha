## Session Summary
The party began their journey in **[[Geography/City/Tre Coedwig\|Tre Coedwig]]**, a dwarven village, where they experienced an uneventful night despite prior tensions from suggestion magic used on the [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|dwarves]]. **Kroc-gar**, a lizardfolk warlock, completed a carving ritual on a piece taken from a defeated dryad, while the group faced hostility from local [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|dwarf]] loggers during breakfast. After confirming the unavailability of mounts from **[[NPCs/Contemporary/Voshtai\|Voshtai]]** at **[[Geography/Locale/Siorlann\|Siorlann]]**, the party decided to resupply at the general outfitter before departing for **[[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]]**.

As they left **[[Geography/City/Tre Coedwig\|Tre Coedwig]]**, they encountered **Marcus**, a [[The Tribes/Dwarves\|dwarf]] guard leader, who expressed disdain towards them, while the party noted signs of recovery in **[[Geography/Region/Fossmore Forest\|Fossmore Forest]]**. Their travel path deviated eastward into the forest, leading them to a luminous patch that imbued them with wild magic. After establishing camp, a sudden winter descended, causing **[[The Campaign/PCs/Sorn Talabrina\|Sorn]]** to suffer exhaustion due to the cold.

During the night, **[[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]]** detected strong magic to the north, leading to the discovery of an old woman, the **Frosted Crone**, who vanished into star-like motes. The next day, the party found a gruesome corpse of a [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|wood elf]], suggesting cannibalism, and triggered an arrow trap made from plant growth. As they continued, they entered an area of auditory illusions that caused fear among some party members.

The session culminated at a pond with a **Singing Lotus**, where they encountered a disembodied Elvish voice that questioned their intentions. The party debated their options for passage, weighing the risks of confrontation against the potential for safe passage, as the path behind them sealed with thorny vines, leaving them at a standoff with the unseen presence ahead.  



## Key Moments
### Gruesome Discovery of the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elf]]
The forest air is thick with the metallic scent of blood as the party discovers a [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|wood elf]] hanging in a vine snare, his disemboweled body indicating a brutal end. Precise cuts suggest a skilled dagger. [[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]], shaken, mutters about being woken up. [[The Campaign/PCs/Kroq-Gar\|Sotek]] hesitates, seeking guidance as the group confronts the grim reality of the elf's fate. Silence hangs heavy, broken only by rustling leaves.

### Whispers Over the Lotus Pond
The party reaches a shimmering pond with a wooden boardwalk leading to a colossal lotus flower. An unsettling Elvish melody stirs unease, reminding Kroc-gar of a similar pond. Will you approach the lotus, attracted by its beauty, or retreat to the trees, wary of the whispers? The allure of the pond contrasts with an undercurrent of dread, leaving the party conflicted.

### Chilled to the Bone
The frigid air swept through the camp as [[The Campaign/PCs/Sorn Talabrina\|Sorn]] jolted awake, stark naked against the chill. "You just had to sleep naked," the Game Master quipped, emphasizing [[The Campaign/PCs/Sorn Talabrina\|Sorn]]'s predicament while [[The Campaign/PCs/Kallista Shadowhorn\|Kallista]] slept warmly. [[The Campaign/PCs/Kroq-Gar\|Sotek]] and [[The Campaign/PCs/Grix Gildred\|Grix]] exchanged amused glances, feeling only a slight chill.
