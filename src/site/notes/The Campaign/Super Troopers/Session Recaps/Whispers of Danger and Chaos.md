## Session Summary
The party traversed a forest path, successfully bypassing several traps, to reach a clearing with a pond surrounded by a boardwalk of woven roots and vines. At the center of the pond was a large Singing Lotus, and upon arrival, the party heard a whispered singing voice. The path behind them was blocked by a thick wall of thorny trees, and a disembodied voice declared it would not let them leave, claiming hunger.

Kroc-gar assessed the situation, identifying the singing plants as potentially dangerous anomalies. [[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]] examined the pond and found it undrinkable. As [[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]] advanced, a lily pad collapsed, causing him to fall into the water, where he was grabbed by vines. [[The Campaign/PCs/Grix Gildred\|Grix]] threw a rope to rescue him, but a hidden archer fired an arrow, revealing a hostile presence. Combat began as the voice mocked the party and threatened to make them its dinner.

During the battle, [[The Campaign/PCs/Kallista Shadowhorn\|Kallista]] incinerated the lotus, revealing a crazed [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elf]] who vowed revenge for the destruction. The [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elf]] began singing, causing trees to shift and provide him cover. The party engaged in combat, with various spells and attacks exchanged. Wild magic surges affected several party members, granting unexpected abilities and causing chaos.

The [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elf]] was ultimately killed by [[The Campaign/PCs/Grix Gildred\|Grix]], but the boardwalk began to collapse afterward. The party managed to secure the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elf]]'s body and loot valuable items, including a [[The Tribes/Kenku\|Kenku]] Necklace and [[The Campaign/Items/Thalin's Diary\|Thalin's Diary]]. As they set up camp for the night, [[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]] shared dark findings related to the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elf]] and a changeling named Petal. The night passed with watches set, and the next morning, the party found a clear path leading to the city, concluding the session as they sighted [[Geography/Locale/Siorlann\|Siorlann]] on the banks of the [[Geography/Region/Granna Abhaine\|Granna Abhaine]].  



## Key Moments
### Kroc-gar's Grim Trophy
In the dim forest, Kroc-gar stood over the disemboweled [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|wood elf]], his blade glinting with blood. He severed the elf's head and presented it to [[The Campaign/PCs/Jexim Hidker\|Jexim]], who prepared to cast Gentle Repose.

### Kroc-gar's Invisible Leap
In a shadowy forest, Kroc-gar, the Lizardfolk Warlock, leaps across a chasm, casting Invisibility mid-air and landing silently behind a tree, hidden from a frenzied [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|wood elf]]. He uses his teleportation ability to close the gap for a strike, feeling the tension as he dashes forward. His stealth gives him a fleeting advantage in this deadly encounter.

### Whispers of The Singing Lotus
In a clearing in [[Geography/Region/Fossmore Forest\|Fossmore Forest]], the party discovered a serene pond with a shimmering Singing Lotus. A melodic voice urged them closer, saying, "I can't let you leave... especially not when I hunger so." With their path back obscured, they faced a choice: embrace the enchanting call or retreat into the shadows. The air was filled with anticipation, leaving them torn between curiosity and caution.
