#### Quick Summary

> Since the Sundering, the Tiefling’s had devoted themselves to both the Summer Queen and her alter ego, The Winter Crone. In the aftermath of the first Binding, the Tuatha were looking for a place to lay blame, and the cold nature of the Tiefling’s was convenient for many of the tribes. Through a dedicated misinformation campaign by the Dwarves, the Tiefling’s began to feel unwelcome and eventually persecuted. This culminated in a purge of Tiefling’s from other settlements and a war to see them exiled beyond the peace of the Tir. The Battle of Govannon’s Fury was a major blow to the Tiefling’s and ended the War of Caillech’s Sorrow in the Dwarves' favor.
