#### Summary
> The stout and hardy Dwarves of [[Geography/Region/Ceardlachd Forest\|Ceardlachd Forest]] are renowned craftsmen, with a strong work-ethic that makes them industrious when it comes to extracting the resources of the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]]. Steady on their feet, with a strong resistance to the many poisons that can be encountered across the land, they often can be found outside of their homeland serving as warriors or as Treasair's. 
>  Created by the God of the Forge, [[Religion/Pantheon/Govannon\|Govannon]], they work tirelessly to perfect their craft, whether that be simple wood-working, masonry, or working with the newly discovered wrought iron. It was the Dwarves who first developed advanced carpentry, which elevated [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] from tents to more permanent structures.
>  The Dwarves view themselves as the bulwark against the chaos of [[Religion/Pantheon/Caillech\|Caillech]], specifically targeting [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] found defying their long-standing exile. It is Dwarven patrols who defend passes in the [[Geography/Region/Cnoic Aran Mountains\|Cnoic Aran Mountains]] and frequently engage in skirmishes against [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tiefling]] marauders. Along their southern and eastern borders, they have more recently had dealings with the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]], who see the Dwarven love of crafting as a perversion of nature. 

#### Culture
> Favouring earthy browns and deep greens in their clothing and artwork, Dwarven culture focuses on two primary elements - the connection between the land and the forge, and that of Order. Their music is deep and resonant, with lilting flutes serving to accent their songs. Myth's and songs told by the Dwarves emphasize their mastery over nature and the chaos of the [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|Anord]] and speaks of their great deeds in preventing the [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tiefling]] from bringing the same doom that befell the [[Factions/Ancient Ones\|Ancient Ones]] upon the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]]. 
> 
> Dwarves rely on hardy and high-density meals that favour caloric intake over flavour.   For them, food is fuel and any enjoyment of it is an added bonus more than something to be celebrated. Forest farming supplies the bulk of their nutrition, consisting of mosses, fungi, and nuts of the [[Geography/Region/Ceardlachd Forest\|Ceardlachd Forest]]. Venison from the forest, and mutton from the Crag-Rams of the [[Geography/Region/Cnoic Aran Mountains\|Cnoic Aran Mountains]] are provided by the hunters and trackers of the Clans. The staple food of "Stone Bannock", a rock-hard loaf of ground acorns and chestnuts, can survive weeks in a hard pack and is often softened by gravy or other liquids before eating. Their strong natural constitution allows the Dwarves to use ingredients that could kill other [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]]; meats are cured in the acrid smoke of toxic yew, while stews are spiced with stinging nettles and bioluminescent "Gloom-Caps" that offer a pleasant, tingling heat to a Dwarf but sickening toxicity to an outsider. These heavy meals are typically washed down with thick, fermented pine-sap liquor, providing a potent burst of sugar and alcohol to sustain them through long shifts

###### Social Structure
> Traditionally, Dwarven society was built upon a foundation of collective stewardship and mutual obligation. Land was held by the Clan rather than the individual, entrusted to an elected Chieftain whose authority was conditional; if he failed to defend or manage the hold, he could be deposed by his kin. To forge unbreakable alliances, the Major Clans practiced a system of fosterage, sending their youth to be raised by other families to create deep bonds of loyalty across bloodlines. Justice was similarly communal, where a crime committed by one Dwarf became a debt owed by their entire clan. Economically, the Major Clans acted as patrons, leasing essential tools to the Lesser Clans in exchange for a portion of their production.
> 
> Dwarven names are indicative of their place within the social structure. For the heroes and great leaders, a deed or physical trait replaces their family name and then is inherited by their descendants. These are known as the Gaisce (Gosh-ka) Clans. Major Clans, such as the historic Clan [[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]], have land rights, control major elements of the economy, and often lend their names to settlements they hold. For Faoi (fwee) clans, they are subservient to one of the major clans and their surname reflects this. A Dwarf from Clan Drealach that lives in [[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]] would thus have the surname  of Drealach-faoi-[[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]]. 

###### Customs
>Meals are communal affairs for the Dwarves. Traditionally, they were be served in mess halls provided by the Gaisce Clans. Meals were seen as a necessary reprieve from the toil of their work, and the kinship forged during meals and feasts served to further strengthen the bonds between Clans. Recently, many of these halls have been replaced by industrial canteens run by the [[Factions/Ord Directorate\|Ord Directorate]], where meals are to be taken in silence and the quality of the food is tied to the output of the laborers. 
>
>A traditional Dwarven greeting is the "Root Grip", where Dwarves would clasp their forearms together and squeezing firmly. This symbolize roots tangling together, and that one lends strength to the other in order to stand tall. Under the [[Factions/Ord Directorate\|Ord Directorate]], this has become a test of strength, to see if one party falters. 
>
>Young Dwarves take part in An Snoi-Fior (An Snee-Feer) on their 13th birthday. During this rite of passage, they are expected to venture into the forest alone, find a fallen bough, and carve a functional mechanism from it. This could be something such as a musical instrument or a lock, and it would demonstrate their mastery of both survival and carpentry skills. 
>
> Dwarven couples intending to be wed would carve a token together, known as the Heart Joint. The betrothed independently carve two parts of the Heart Joint and when they are done they slide the two pieces together. If they "join" with no visible gaps or seems, the union is considered blessed by [[Religion/Pantheon/Govannon\|Govannon]]. The type of wood is chosen based on a symbolic quality to signify their relationship.

#### Economics 
> The Primary export for the Dwarves is in high quality masterworks of wood and stone. With the [[History/Discovery of Iron\|discovery of Iron]], their economy is beginning to shift more towards the production of iron implements, and iron weapons and armors are beginning to be seen across the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]]. They import raw peat iron from the [[The Tribes/Lizard-folk\|Lizard-folk]] through trade routes in [[Geography/Region/Mosslight Murmur\|Mosslight Murmur]] and have an alliance with the [[Factions/Cogswyr Syndicate\|Cogswyr Syndicate]] to supply refined iron for their gizmos and gadgets. 
> Dwarven carpenters and masons will travel the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]] offering their services. In this way, [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] can have sturdy wood homes and stone structures built for them, or fine monuments erected. These Dwarven craftsmen fetch a high price for their work and are common specifically in [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]]. 

#### History
###### Early History - 100 - 350 ATE
> As [[History/The Sundering Plague\|the Sundering Plague]] ravaged the settlement of [[Geography/City/Aite-Briethe\|Aite-Briethe]], many of the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] began to strike out into the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]] to try and find new homes. A group of them struck out to the West, settling amongst the trees of the [[Geography/Region/Ceardlachd Forest\|Ceardlachd Forest]] and the valleys of the [[Geography/Region/Cnoic Aran Mountains\|Cnoic Aran Mountains]]. These [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] would form the basis of the Dwarven Clan system, and became the founding members of the Major Clans. Clan Ceardaigh demonstrated great skill and love of wood-working and masonry and founded the city of [[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]]. 
> 
> Within several decades Clan Ceardaigh came to believe they could weaken and even eliminate [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|the Anord]] through the strict imposition of order and authority over their surroundings. They attempted to bring the other [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] under their sway, but they were resisted by the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]] and the [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tieflings]]. Finding allies with the early [[The Tribes/Gnomes\|Gnomes]], Clan Ceardaigh and the Dwarves declared outright war against those who would not fall in line. The war was lost when the [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] unleashed [[History/The Rimeblast\|the Rimeblast]] and destroyed the original foundations of [[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]]. The Dwarves resolved that Order should thus be crafted and not imposed. 


###### [[History/War of Caillech's Sorrow\|Exile of Caillech's Disciples]] and [[History/Govannon's Fury\|Govannon's Fury]]
> After centuries of the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]] being subjected to the chaos of [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|the Anord]], many [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] were beginning to believe that the duplicitous [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] were to blame. Dwarven devotee's of [[Religion/Pantheon/Govannon\|Govannon]] argued that the [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] were truthfully children of the Goddess [[Religion/Pantheon/Caillech\|Caillech]], and that this heritage was anathema to the stability the people so desperately craved. Dwarven Clans led the charge in rounding up [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tiefling]] marauders who had tried to infiltrate settlements in the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]]. 
> 
> [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] organized a resistance force that struck against the Dwarven patrols. This war was short, as the Dwarves struck a deal with [[Religion/Pantheon/Govannon\|Govannon]]. They swore an oath to him to always value Order and the Forge and to serve as a shield against the evil of [[Religion/Pantheon/Caillech\|Caillech]] and her Children. In exchange, they received instructions on the construction of a magical weapon called Govannons Fury they used to decimate the last [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tiefling]] stronghold of Caillechs Foot. With this victory, the [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] were permanently exiled from the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]] and to the confines of the harsh and inhospitable [[Geography/Region/Cnoic Aran Mountains\|Cnoic Aran Mountains]]. 

###### The Thread-Breakers War
> During the Thread-Breakers War of the 1050's, the Dwarves were hard hit on two fronts. [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elf]] warbands struck at their centers of industry from the South-East, while [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tiefling]] exiles from the [[Geography/Region/Cnoic Aran Mountains\|Cnoic Aran Mountains]] constantly attacked from the North and West. The Dwarven clans allied with the [[The Tribes/Gnomes\|Gnomes]] of the [[Factions/Cogswyr Syndicate\|Cogswyr Syndicate]] but were kept in the dark about the Gnomish plans to duplicate the knot-making process that led to [[History/The Rune-Breach Folly\|the Rune-Breach Folly]]. The Dwarves came to rely heavily upon [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] reinforcements, and when the [[Factions/Weave-mothers\|Weave-Mothers]] Peace was negotiated, the Dwarven delegation was instrumental in establishing the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] as the official peacekeeping force of the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]] and for the adoption that all tribes should strive for the betterment of all [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]]. 

###### [[History/Discovery of Iron\|Discovery of Iron]] and the [[History/War of the Severed Root\|War of the Severed Root]]
> Dwarven Craftsmen were among the first to recognize the value of the peat iron that had been discovered by the [[The Tribes/Lizard-folk\|Lizard-folk]]. They began to experiment with it and forged strong and resilient tools and weapons, the like of which had never been seen in the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]]. A trade deal was struck between the Dwarves and the [[The Tribes/Lizard-folk\|Lizard-folk]], and trade caravans between the [[Geography/Region/Draigsreach Peninsula\|Draigsreach Peninsula]] and [[Geography/Region/Ceardlachd Forest\|Ceardlachd Forest]] were soon flowing constantly. 
> 
> Many of the trade routes ran through [[Geography/Region/Fossmore Forest\|Fossmore Forest]], and the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]] were alarmed by this discovery. Convinced that iron was one of many things that doomed the [[Factions/Ancient Ones\|Ancient Ones]], and that the extraction and refining of iron was a cancer upon the land, they began to strike at any trade caravans that crossed their borders. As the iron trade flourished, the Dwarves needed more fuel for their forges and intensified logging operations. Wood Elven Warbands expanded operations against logging crews, and this came to a head in 1568 after an logging camp was completely slaughtered. 
> 
> The Dwarves, led by [[NPCs/Contemporary/Torin Iron-Heart\|Torin Iron-Heart]], fought long and hard to secure both the logging industry and the iron trade, but they were no match for the cowardly guerilla style attacks of the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]]. [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elf]] spies leaked information of an attack on a smaller settlement to the southern borders of [[Geography/Region/Ceardlachd Forest\|Ceardlachd Forest]], and when Dwarven forces were called away from the defense of [[Geography/City/Tre Coedwig\|Tre Coedwig]], [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]] attacked and captured the trading hub. The Dwarven Gaisce and Major Clans were thus forced into signing the [[History/Treaty of Green Ash\|Treaty of Green Ash]]. 

###### The [[Factions/Ord Directorate\|Ord Directorate]]
> In the aftermath of the [[History/Treaty of Green Ash\|Treaty of Green Ash]], the Dwarven economy was hard hit by trade restrictions and the losses incurred during the war. Even with outside aid arranged by [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] and Weave-Mother diplomats, many Dwarves starved and struggled. Sensing the growing resentment and despair of his people, [[NPCs/Contemporary/Torin Iron-Heart\|Torin Iron-Heart]] began to gather support amongst the veterans and Faoi Clans. He points to trade disputes unfairly decided by the Silk Matrons against Dwarven traders, and that the [[Factions/Cailleotairi\|Cailleotairi]] neutrality during the [[History/War of the Severed Root\|War of the Severed Root]] was a ploy to secretly hide their alliance with the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]]. After the [[History/Rogue Scholar's Crisis\|Rogue Scholar's Crisis]], he lead a group of loyalists to [[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]] and executed Clan Leaders who he argued had betrayed the Dwarven people, and supports the election of new Clan leaders who would in turn support him. With support amongst all branches of Dwarven society, [[NPCs/Contemporary/Torin Iron-Heart\|Torin]] declared the foundation of the [[Factions/Ord Directorate\|Ord Directorate]], and himself as the Ord-Ri.
