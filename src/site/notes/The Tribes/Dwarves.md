#### Summary
> The stout and hardy Dwarves of [[Geography/Region/Ceardlachd Forest\|Ceardlachd Forest]] are renowned craftsmen, with a strong work-ethic that makes them industrious when it comes to extracting the resources of the [[01 -Tir Na Beatha\|Tir]]. Steady on their feet, with a strong resistance to the many poisons that can be encountered across the land, they often can be found outside of their homeland serving as warriors or as Treasair's. 
>  Created by the God of the Forge, [[Religion/Pantheon/Govannon\|Govannon]], they work tirelessly to perfect their craft, whether that be simple wood-working, masonry, or working with the newly discovered wrought iron. It was the Dwarves who first developed advanced carpentry, which elevated [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]] from tents to more permanent structures.
>  The Dwarves view themselves as the bulwark against the chaos of [[Religion/Pantheon/Caillech\|Caillech]], specifically targeting [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] found defying their long-standing exile. It is Dwarven patrols who defend passes in the [[Geography/Region/Cnoic Aran Mountains\|Cnoic Aran Mountains]] and frequently engage in skirmishes against [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tiefling]] marauders. Along their southern and eastern borders, they have more recently had dealings with the [[The Tribes/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]], who see the Dwarven love of crafting as a perversion of nature. 

#### Culture
> Favouring earthy browns and deep greens in their clothing and artwork, Dwarven culture focuses on two primary elements - the connection between the land and the forge, and that of Order. Their music is deep and resonant, with lilting flutes serving to accent their songs. Myth's and songs told by the Dwarves emphasize their mastery over nature and the chaos of the [[Cultural Matters/Metaphysics/The Anord\|Anord]] and speaks of their great deeds in preventing the [[The Tribes/Tieflings\|Tiefling]] from bringing the same doom that befell the [[Factions/Ancient Ones\|Ancient Ones]] upon the [[02 - Tuatha\|Tuatha]]. 
> 
> Dwarven names are indicative of their place within the social structure. For the heroes and great leaders, a deed or physical trait replaces their family name and then is inherited by their descendants. These are known as the Gaisce (Gosh-ka) Clans. Major Clans, such as the historic Clan [[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]], have land rights, control major elements of the economy, and often lend their names to settlements they hold. For Faoi (fwee) clans, they are subservient to one of the major clans and their surname reflects. A Dwarf from clan Drealach that lives in [[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]] would thus have the surname  of Drealach-faoi-[[Geography/City/Ceardaigh\|Ceardaigh]].
